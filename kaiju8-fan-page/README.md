# The Kaiju Project – Fan Page for Kaiju No 8

This is a personal fan project dedicated to **Kaiju No 8**, designed to showcase key character forms and abilities in an interactive, visually appealing layout.

The project started on **Mimo.org** as part of my learning journey in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I wrote the majority of the code myself, I used some **AI assistance** for the JavaScript components as I’m still exploring advanced interactivity.
